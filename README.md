# Earthquake GeoJSON Mapping

This project displays earthquakes recorded by the USGS over the past week on and interactive map.

### Technology

* Leaflet.js
* Javascript
* Mapbox

### Level 1: Basic Visualization

![2-BasicMap](Images/2-BasicMap.png)

Visualiza the earthquake data set with leaflet.

#### Data set

![3-Data](Images/3-Data.png)

The USGS provides earthquake data in [USGS GeoJSON Feed](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php) page and picked a data set to visualize.


### Level 2: More Data (Optional)

![5-Advanced](Images/5-Advanced.png)

The USGS wants you to plot a second data set on your map to illustrate the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity. Data on tectonic plates can be found at [https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates](https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates).

In this step we are going to..

* Plot a second data set on our map.
* Add a number of base maps to choose from as well as separate out our two different data sets into overlays that can be turned on and off independently.
* Add layer controls to our map.
